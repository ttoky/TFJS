Since only male participants competed in the season 2, all the training data were male faces and this small training dataset generated an overfitted shallow model.  Training was done using CNN algorithm with keras and tf.js with p5.js  is used for the web based prediction . Of course, viewers select their favorite person not only on appearance, but on performances and attitudes as well. However, there is no doubt about how their physical charm is important in determining the preference. The training data clearly produced an overfitted model because of the lack of diverse data. But, this overfitted model lets us think about what would happen if a machine trained without diversity made decisions. With this project, we expect users to have fun getting grades on their appearance from the overfitted model, and also at the same time, think about our social bias and how we can avoid the overfitted society where the lack of diversity is ignored.";
