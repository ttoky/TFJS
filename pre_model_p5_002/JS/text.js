topText.innerHTML = "‘Produce 101’ is a popular K-pop TV show where one hundred one young participants challenged for becoming a K-pop idol star. Each participant received a grade from A to F according to the votes from the viewers every week, and at the end of show, only top ten survivors debuted as a team. This interactive artwork asks users questions about what would happen if a machine made a decision on behalf of a person as many things would be determined by A.I. in the future society. In this web-based work, upon the web camera capture of a male’s face, the user receives the grade from A to F from the machine that has been trained using the results from the ‘Produce 101’. The grade might be what we would confront in the overfitted society where the lack of diversity is ignored.";
